# MVP Steps Remaining

1) Fix database connectivity and ensure Prisma works end-to-end (blocker).
2) Replace mock data with real API calls on Discover, Network, Notifications, Settings, and detail pages.
3) Implement core missing APIs: Network, Notifications, Search, Settings (save/delete), Verify stubs.
4) Build Messaging (API + UI) and add at least basic real-time/polling updates.
5) Add Applications UI using existing `/api/applications`.
6) Add basic real-time notifications (new items, mark-as-read sync).
7) Hardening: authz checks, input validation, pagination, error states, logging hooks.
