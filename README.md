# 🌉 The Bridge Platform

> **Connecting students to careers through verified credentials and AI-powered guidance.**

---

## 👋 Welcome to The Bridge

**What is this?**
Imagine a professional network (like LinkedIn) designed specifically for students, but smarter. The Bridge Platform isn't just about who you know; it's about **proving what you know**. It connects students, educational institutions, and employers in a trusted ecosystem.

**Who is it for?**
*   **Students**: To build a verified portfolio, find career paths, and get hired.
*   **Employers**: To find talent with verified skills (no more guessing if a resume is true).
*   **Institutions**: To issue digital credentials that actually mean something in the job market.

---

## 🚀 Key Features (What can you do?)

### 1. 🎓 Smart Dashboard
Think of this as your career command center. Instead of a feed of random posts, you get:
*   **Personalized Job Matches**: Jobs that actually fit your skills.
*   **Trending Skills**: See what skills are hot in the market right now (e.g., "Quantum Computing is up 42%").

### 2. 🎒 Credential Wallet
A digital backpack for your achievements.
*   **Blockchain Verification**: When you earn a certificate, it's "stamped" digitally on the Solana blockchain. This means it's impossible to fake. Employers can scan a QR code to instantly verify you really earned that degree or certificate.
*   **On-Chain Verification**: Every credential hash is stored on Solana blockchain, making verification instant and tamper-proof.
*   **Issuer Management**: Institutions can issue, verify, and revoke credentials with full blockchain transparency.

### 3. 🧭 Career Navigator
A GPS for your professional life.
*   **Pathfinding**: Want to be a "Senior AI Engineer"? The system looks at where you are now and draws a map of exactly what skills, courses, and roles you need to get there.
*   **Skill Gap Analysis**: It tells you, "You're great at Python, but you need to learn TensorFlow to get this job."

### 4. 📂 Project Portfolio
Show, don't just tell.
*   Upload your actual work (videos, code, designs).
*   Tag collaborators (who you worked with).
*   Get endorsements from mentors.

### 5. 🤖 AI-Powered Features
Intelligent assistance powered by OpenAI.
*   **Resume Parsing**: Upload your PDF resume and watch it auto-fill your profile. The AI extracts your skills, experience, and education automatically.
*   **Semantic Search**: Find opportunities using natural language. Search for "React developer" and find jobs mentioning "Frontend engineer" or "JavaScript specialist" - the AI understands meaning, not just keywords.
*   **Match Explanations**: Get AI-generated explanations for why a job matches your profile. "This role matches because you have 3+ years of React experience and the company values full-stack developers."
*   **Skill Verification Quizzes**: Prove your skills with AI-generated quizzes tailored to your expertise level (beginner, intermediate, advanced).

### 6. ⛓️ Blockchain Integration
Tamper-proof credential verification on Solana.
*   **Automatic Anchoring**: Credentials are automatically anchored on Solana blockchain when issued by institutions.
*   **Public Verification**: Anyone can verify a credential's authenticity by scanning a QR code - no login required.
*   **Low Cost**: Anchoring costs ~$0.000002 per credential (extremely affordable).
*   **Wallet Monitoring**: Automatic balance checks ensure credentials can always be anchored.

## ⚡ Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project on your computer.

### Prerequisites
*   **Node.js** (Version 18 or higher) installed.
*   **PostgreSQL** database (local or cloud).
*   **Git** installed.

### Quick Setup

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TommyBangs/thebridgesl.git
    cd thebridgesl
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables**:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # Edit .env with your database URL, NextAuth secret, OpenAI API key, and Solana configuration
    ```
    
    **Required Environment Variables:**
    *   `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
    *   `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - Secret for NextAuth.js sessions
    *   `OPENAI_API_KEY` - OpenAI API key (starts with `sk-`) for AI features
    *   `SOLANA_RPC_URL` - Solana RPC endpoint (default: `https://api.devnet.solana.com`)
    *   `SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY` - Base58-encoded Solana private key for credential anchoring
    *   `SOLANA_CLUSTER` - `devnet` or `mainnet-beta`

4.  **Set up the database**:
    ```bash
    npm run db:generate
    npm run db:push
    ```
    
    **Enable pgvector extension** (for AI semantic search):
    ```sql
    CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
    ```
    
    **Note:** If you encounter Prisma generation errors on Windows, close your IDE and run `npx prisma generate` in an Administrator PowerShell window.

5.  **Run the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

6.  **Open your browser**:
    Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and sign up for an account!

### Detailed Setup

For detailed setup instructions, including database configuration and troubleshooting, see **[SETUP.md](./SETUP.md)**.

**Note**: Currently experiencing database connectivity issues with Prisma. Ensure your `DATABASE_URL` is correctly configured before running the application.
